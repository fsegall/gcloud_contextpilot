**Discussion Topic:** Overall, do you suggest any changes to improve the code base or functionality? 

## Background

During the retrospective discussion on 'Overall, do you suggest any changes to improve the code base or functionality? ', the following improvements were identified:

- ⚠️ 1 errors occurred across all agents. Review error logs.
- ⏸️ Idle agents: spec, development. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- 📋 Spec Agent: We should conduct a thorough review of existing feature specifications to identify any areas of ambiguity or incompleteness that could lead to technical debt or misaligned development. Clarifying these early on will improve validation accuracy.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
