## Background

During the retrospective discussion on 'Seven unit tests are failing. Can we fix it?', the following improvements were identified:

- Agents processed 2 events in this cycle.
- ⚠️ 1 errors occurred across all agents. Review error logs.
- ⏸️ Idle agents: spec, development, context, milestone. Consider reviewing their triggers.

## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps
