**Discussion Topic:** Can we improve agent access to the sandbox repo through Github Codespaces?

## Background

During the retrospective discussion on 'Can we improve agent access to the sandbox repo through Github Codespaces?', the following improvements were identified:

- ⚠️ 1 errors occurred across all agents. Review error logs.
- ⏸️ Idle agents: spec, development. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- 📋 Spec Agent: We need clear technical specifications for agent environment configurations within Codespaces, defining access protocols, pre-installed dependencies, and validation criteria for successful agent operations.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
