**Discussion Topic:** How can you draft a Polkadot blockchain adapter for the reward system? 

## Background

During the retrospective discussion on 'How can you draft a Polkadot blockchain adapter for the reward system? ', the following improvements were identified:

- ⏸️ Idle agents: spec. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- 📦 Context Agent: We should begin by retrieving all existing Polkadot integration patterns, Substrate RPC specifications, and any relevant reward system schemas to inform the adapter's design.
- 📋 Spec Agent: The draft must clearly outline the adapter's functional requirements, define the API for reward submissions and queries, and specify expected error handling mechanisms.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
