## Background

After analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:

- ⏸️ Idle agents: retrospective. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- 📦 Context Agent: 'How can we add relevant new documentation to context? ' relates to our context management strategy. We should ensure new content is properly indexed and tagged for retrieval.
- 📋 Spec Agent: Regarding 'How can we add relevant new documentation to context? ', we need clear specifications for content inclusion criteria and validation rules.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
