# Agent System Improvements

**Generated from Retrospective:** retro-20251018-145622
**Date:** 2025-10-18T14:56:22.776107+00:00

## Background

After analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:

- Agents processed 3 events in this cycle.
- ⏸️ Idle agents: spec. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- 📋 Spec Agent: Define quantifiable non-functional requirements (performance, security) early in the lifecycle to set clear success boundaries. Implement automated requirements traceability checks to ensure every feature is validated against its original technical specification before deployment.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
